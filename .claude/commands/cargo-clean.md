Run `cargo clean` on the main repo and all registered git worktrees to free up Rust build artifacts.

## Usage

```
/cargo-clean [--worktrees-only]
```

- No flags: cleans the main repo **and** all worktrees
- `--worktrees-only`: skips the main repo, only cleans worktrees

## Instructions

1. Parse the user's invocation for the `--worktrees-only` flag.

2. Get all registered worktrees by running:
   ```bash
   git -C /Users/randlee/Documents/github/terminalg worktree list
   ```

3. Parse the output into a list of paths. The first entry is always the main repo.

4. Build the target list:
   - If `--worktrees-only`: exclude the first entry (main repo path)
   - Otherwise: include all entries

5. For each path in the target list, run:
   ```bash
   cargo clean --manifest-path "<path>/Cargo.toml"
   ```
   Print the path being cleaned before each run, and the cargo output (files removed, GiB freed) after.

6. Print a summary table showing each worktree, files removed, and space freed.
   Include a total row summing files and GiB across all cleaned worktrees.
